# PDGM: Progressive Denoising Generation Model

We introduce the Progressive Denoising conditional Generation Model (PDGM) that achieves high-fidelity image/ music generation.  Recent advances explore two different families of generative models, autoregressive and diffusion, in contrast, we opening opportunities to bridging the gap between these two powerful models. In particular, PDGM creates condition image/music generation according to the order of importance scores.
